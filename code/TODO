- Clean the print solution function. Inefficient to build a matrix to output it...
- Output in the .txt format that gmsh can generate too
- make GAMMA determined at compile time (limiter, physics, printsol, initcond)
- rework initial conditions
- Add CFL condition

FOR GOING TO 2D:
- 2D physics functions
- 2D limiter 
- Change of basis is disabled
