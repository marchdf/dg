- Clean the print solution function. Inefficient to build a matrix to output it...
- Output in the .txt format that gmsh can generate too
- make GAMMA determined at compile time (limiter, physics, printsol, initcond)
- clean initial conditions
- Add CFL condition
- clean output functions 
- clean if conditions on dimensions
- clean Riemann solvers
- entropy fix for Roe (http://www.cfdbooks.com/cfdcodes/oned_euler_fluxes_v4.f90)
- clean the flux functions so that the spacing is the same.

FOR GOING TO 2D:
- 2D physics functions: ROE left to do (http://www.cfdbooks.com/cfdcodes/twod_euler_fluxes_v2.f90)
- 2D limiter (boundary condition thing...)
- Change of basis for 2D
- I think my boundary conditions don't work... (independent x-y conditions?)
