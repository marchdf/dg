\brief List of things to do.
\page mytodo The General TODO List

\mytodo OUTPUT
  - Add capability to output in the .txt format that gmsh can generate too
  - hdf5? Binary format to compress data?
  - check for NAN

\mytodo IC
  - Clean initial conditions
  - Clean initialization of initial conditions... determine at compile time?
  - Design some generic ICs that can be made in the deck (maybe a LR state thing for now)

\mytodo RIEMANN SOLVERS
  - Optimize Riemann solvers. I think they are inefficient. Also, make the 1D closer to the 2D implementation
  - Add an entropy fix for Roe (http://www.cfdbooks.com/cfdcodes/oned_euler_fluxes_v4.f90)
  - add HLLC

\mytodo LIMITING
  - combine both reconstruct energy implementations
  - It's a very ugly implementation right now... 
  - hrl1D could be cleaned a little to copy what we do for hri
  - I have powersXYZG and V1D, could I combine the two to avoid ifdefs?
  - ifdefs on dims in HRL, MYL, M2L
  - move some of these functions to .cc files?
  - Get a 1D/2D version: put ifdef ONED in header file so I can call the class the same thing (Limiting). Actually do a strucutured/unstructured file?
  - idea to clean: instead of different constructors, have one main constructor and extra functions to set the parts that are different (eg. Limiter.setNeighbors(neighbors))

\mytodo PARALLEL
  - Play with buffered send, isend, send, sendrecv_replace?

\mytodo 2D PHYSICS
  - passive/multifluid HLL

\mytodo BASIS TRANSFORMS (for HR)
  - put in a separate class

\mytodo BLAS
  - Can the axpy in rk.h be changed to a blas3 level function?
  - Can the copy in rk.h be changed/reduced?
  - see write-up for the dg_solver.h ideas

\mytodo PROFILER
  - Add some sort of timer to these functions?
	
\mytodo OTHER
  - Clean if conditions on dimensions: they are all over the place. Can they be reduced?
  - Does shifts works in 1D? It does not!
  - make things more object oriented to reduce the number of parameters passed around
  - maybe make a struct for the numbers (Ns,NE, etc)
  - factorial function is defined 3 times (at least)
  - macros to wrap functions: eg. GPU(communicateGhosts) or GAMMAMODEL(...)
  - memcpy is evil in c++, don't use it: it doesn't do a deep copy. replace memcpy with blascopy?
  - solve kernel: make the matrix-matrix product more efficient?
  - idea to speed up UPA computation: do it on the nodal average (computed in sensor) (instead of at each node)
  - Add malloc wrapper for C (to replace new and merge with cudamalloc) eg: MALLOC(...) which selects GPU or CPU version + increments a counter

\mytodo DOXYGEN
  - it's not documenting both versions of CommunicateGhosts properly.
  - ifdefs with CPU and GPU will only go to one of those.
  - constructors in limiting not all showing up
