- Clean the print solution function. Inefficient to build a matrix to output it...
- Output in the .txt format that gmsh can generate too
- make GAMMA determined at compile time (limiter, physics, printsol, initcond)
- clean initial conditions
- Add CFL condition
- clean output functions 
- clean if conditions on dimensions

FOR GOING TO 2D:
- 2D physics functions: RUS (vap thing), ROE, and HLL left to do
- 2D limiter (boundary condition thing...)
- Change of basis
