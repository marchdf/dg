KNOWN BUGS
  - M2L + MPI: something isn't working at the edges btwn partitions
  - Can't preserve hydrostatic equilibrium with gravity...

OUTPUT
  - Inefficient to build a matrix to output it...
  - Add capability to output in the .txt format that gmsh can generate too
  - Make into a class to do this (yes to avoid re-initializing matrices)
  - restart files?
  - hdf5? Binary format to compress data?

IC
  - Clean initial conditions
  - Clean initialization of initial conditions... determine at compile time?
  - Design some generic ICs that can be made in the deck (maybe a LR state thing for now)

RIEMANN SOLVERS
  - Optimize Riemann solvers. I think they are inefficient. Also, make the 1D closer to the 2D implementation
  - Add an entropy fix for Roe (http://www.cfdbooks.com/cfdcodes/oned_euler_fluxes_v4.f90)
  - add HLLC

LIMITING
  - It's a very ugly implementation right now...
  - I have powersXYZG and V1D, could I combine the two to avoid ifdefs?
  - ifdefs on dims in HRL, MYL, M2L
  - move some of these functions to .cc files?
  - Get a 1D/2D version: put ifdef ONED in header file so I can call the class the same thing (Limiting). Actually do a strucutured/unstructured file?
  - idea to clean: instead of different constructors, have one main constructor and extra functions to set the parts that are different (eg. Limiter.setNeighbors(neighbors))

PARALLEL
  - Play with buffered send, isend, send, sendrecv_replace?

2D PHYSICS
  - passive/multifluid HLL

BASIS TRANSFORMS (for HR)
  - put in a separate class

BLAS
  - Can the axpy in rk.h be changed to a blas3 level function?
  - Can the copy in rk.h be changed/reduced?
  - see write-up for the dg_solver.h ideas

PROFILER
  - Add some sort of timer to these functions?
	
OTHER
  - Clean if conditions on dimensions: they are all over the place. Can they be reduced?
  - Remove cpu_ in the function names (not necessary now)
  - Does shifts works in 1D? It does not!
  - clean the deletes in main. Only have the class deleting the vectors it creates. (eg. in main I delete arrays created in simpleMesh)
