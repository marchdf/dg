This folder contains some sample meshes for some problems. With all
these files you should be able to build the mesh you want.

One dimensional:
- line.geo: 1D line with zero-gradient boundary conditions

Two dimensional:
- wedge_stretching.geo: Illustrates how to make an unstructured grid
  around a wedge and stretch the grid in the farfield.

- drpwall.geo: structured grid with stretching and a wall

- shckdrp.geo: structured grid with stretching in the y-direction

- simblst.geo: simple shock tube geometry

- simblst_long_stretch_half.geo: same as previous with grid stretching
  and half the domain (exploit symmetry)

- square.geo: simple square geometry with 32^2 cells, periodic boundary conditions
