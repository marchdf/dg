The Gauss quadrature functions and \doxyref{polynomial\-Basis}{p.}{classpolynomialBasis} function where in large part inspired by the Gmsh source code ({\tt http\-://geuz.\-org/gmsh/}).

The 2\-D version of the function pnpoly in \doxyref{lagrange\-\_\-particles\-\_\-kernels.\-cu}{p.}{lagrange__particles__kernels_8cu} was written by W Randolph Franklin ({\tt http\-://www.\-ecse.\-rpi.\-edu/$\sim$wrf/pmwiki/pmwiki.\-php}).
