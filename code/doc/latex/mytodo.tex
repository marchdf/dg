\item Clean initial conditions

\item Optimize Riemann solvers. I think they are inefficient. Also, make the 1\-D closer to the 2\-D implementation
\item Add an entropy fix for Roe ({\tt http\-://www.\-cfdbooks.\-com/cfdcodes/oned\-\_\-euler\-\_\-fluxes\-\_\-v4.\-f90})

\item combine both reconstruct energy implementations
\item It's a very ugly implementation right now...
\item hrl1\-D could be cleaned a little to copy what we do for hri
\item I have powers\-X\-Y\-Z\-G and V1\-D, could I combine the two to avoid ifdefs?
\item ifdefs on dims in H\-R\-L, M\-Y\-L, M2\-L
\item move some of these functions to .cc files?
\item Get a 1\-D/2\-D version\-: put ifdef O\-N\-E\-D in header file so I can call the class the same thing (\doxyref{Limiting}{p.}{classLimiting}). Actually do a strucutured/unstructured file?
\item idea to clean\-: instead of different constructors, have one main constructor and extra functions to set the parts that are different (eg. Limiter.\-set\-Neighbors(neighbors))

\item change add\-S\-F\-Q to 2 blas axpy calls?
\item getting the gradients of A\-L\-L the variables is a bit of a drag... I really only need a couple I think (gamma, u?)
\item There might be some overlapping computation (e.\-g. gemm\-\_\-q, gemm\-\_\-sf, evaluate\-\_\-q, evaluate\-\_\-sf, redistribute\-\_\-sf, redistribute\-\_\-q,) that could be run in different streams on the G\-P\-U concurrently.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clean if conditions on dimensions\-: they are all over the place. Can they be reduced?
\item Does shifts works in 1\-D? It does not!
\item make things more object oriented to reduce the number of parameters passed around
\item maybe make a struct for the numbers (Ns,N\-E, etc)
\item factorial function is defined 3 times (at least)
\item macros to wrap functions\-: eg. G\-P\-U(communicate\-Ghosts) or G\-A\-M\-M\-A\-M\-O\-D\-E\-L(...)
\item memcpy is evil in c++, don't use it\-: it doesn't do a deep copy. replace memcpy with blascopy?
\item solve kernel\-: make the matrix-\/matrix product more efficient?
\item idea to speed up U\-P\-A computation\-: do it on the nodal average (computed in sensor) (instead of at each node)
\item Add malloc wrapper for C (to replace new and merge with cudamalloc) eg\-: M\-A\-L\-L\-O\-C(...) which selects G\-P\-U or C\-P\-U version + increments a counter
\item make if conditions into switches (apparently it's faster)
\item make sure there are N\-O (!!) if conditions in my gpu kernels
\item G\-R\-E\-A\-T I\-D\-E\-A\-: put functions that have two versions (C\-P\-U/\-G\-P\-U) into different namespaces then I just need to switch on \char`\"{}using namespace G\-P\-U\char`\"{} \char`\"{}using namespace C\-P\-U\char`\"{}
\item Some data has to be shared by different classes (e.\-g. phi, J and weigth in dg\-\_\-solver and limiting), could we create a shared data class that would group these coherently

\item ifdefs with C\-P\-U and G\-P\-U will only go to one of those.
\item constructors in limiting not all showing up
\item prettify the mainpage
\item add links to a license page and a readme page (kind of like the credits page)
