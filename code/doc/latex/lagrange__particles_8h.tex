This is a pure C\-P\-U implementation of Lagrange particles. The reasons for this are detailed in my notes 10/09/14 but it boils down to the following\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the G\-P\-U would need to know X\-Y\-Z coordinates of the elements (lots of memory use!!) to locate the particle in an element
\item it would be necessary to implement a reduction/search in parallel on the G\-P\-U to (1) find which elements the particles belong to and (2) do this efficiently. This can be complicated to implement well on a G\-P\-U.
\item The main downside\-: at every time step, to advect the particle on the C\-P\-U, I will need to communicate the field quantities from the G\-P\-U to the C\-P\-U. This array will be small (N\-\_\-\-F $\ast$ N\-\_\-s) but still... I think I can live with this because I will most likely not be running many G\-P\-U simulations which require Lagrange particles.
